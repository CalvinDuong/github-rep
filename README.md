Github rep is a scalable version control system inspired by Git. It provides local and remote repositories with features such as add, commit, log, merge, and checkout. The system utilizes a SHA-1 hash-based storage system to encode blob-saved file contents and serializes data in .gitlet files to store old versions of files and the commit tree using the Serializable interface in Java.

Features
Local and Remote Repositories: Manage both local and remote repositories with familiar Git-like commands.
Scalable Version Control: Add, commit, log, merge, and checkout features for effective version control.
SHA-1 Hash-Based Storage: Securely encode blob-saved file contents using SHA-1 hashing.
Serialization: Utilize Java's Serializable interface for efficient serialization of data in .gitlet files.
Blob Storage: Store the content of files efficiently using blob storage
